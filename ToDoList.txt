OOP Things to do:

1: Ensure account numbers are unique 
(
SELECT AccountId from
)

2: Overdraft default to zero on new accounts

3: Update stored procedures to withdraw all fields from customer and Account tables(fully populate account/person object) - DONE

4: Validation of EVERYTHING, Regular expressions for email, no blankspaces etc


6: Transfer funds for outside accounts

7: Edit account details of a user -- similar sql procedure to spUpdateBalance

8: think about structure/encapsulation/polymorphism, how can we reduce amount of code,
organise things better

(Presentation layer methods class, im reusing a lot of code in withdrawal, lodgement etc, RegEx)


9: start commenting code
